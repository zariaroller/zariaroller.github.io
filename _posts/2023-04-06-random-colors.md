For this coding assignment, I wrote an Arduino script that turns an LED on to a random color while a button is being pushed. I found it helpful to reference the example scripts that showed how to use buttons and generate random numbers, so I'd suggest this to anyone attempting this assignment. Pictured below is the working LED.
