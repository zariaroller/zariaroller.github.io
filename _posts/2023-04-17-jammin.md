This program plays a song from the buzzer when the slide switch is on. I transcribed What It Is (Block Boy) by Doechii for my LilyPad. A tip I'd give to my past self is to use the serial monitor to check if parts of the code are working because I nearly lost my mind having to listen to the song every time I ran the program :)
