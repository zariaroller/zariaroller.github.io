For this coding assignment, I created a C program that prints a regular or secret menu based on the user's number choice, then presents them with three menu options. Pictured below is my output. This assignment was pretty straightforward, but if I had to offer a tip to my past self, I'd remind myself that I don't always need to use an "else if" and define a condition if there are only two options for the main "if" statement. Here, the condition is that numberChoice is even or odd, so I only need to explicitly define the condition for even numbers - if it's not even, it can only be odd.
