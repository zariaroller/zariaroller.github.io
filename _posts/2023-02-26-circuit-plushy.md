For my first eTextiles project, I made a light-up plushy. I created a circuit using a battery, LEDs, and conductive thread. When the switch is turned on and the button is pressed, the plushy lights up. I had to do some troubleshooting with connecting multiple pieces of the conductive thread, so I'd recommend starting with a long string to avoid this problem.
