title: Paper Prototype for Final Project

For my final project, I'm creating a detachable fanny pack cover that begins blinking when it gets dark, with the blinking pattern determined by the state of the switch. Pictured below is my paper prototype. The LilyPad will be on the inside/back side, while the LEDs, light sensor, and switch will be visible from the front.
