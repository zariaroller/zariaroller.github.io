For this coding assignment, I combined three previous scripts to make a program that mimics the light-up behavior of three fireflies simultaneously. I'm thanking my past self for taking the more difficult approach to the earlier assignments because that made it much easier to compile the three programs, and I'd recommend this to anyone starting the assignment. Pictured below is my LilyPad with the LEDs lighting up.
