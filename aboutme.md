I'm passionate about textile/fiber arts - knitting, crocheting, even the one-off quilting or embroidery project (see pictures below for some of my work). I also have some experience coding for my economics and data analytics internships. In need of one more Division III class before I graduate this spring, eTextiles was the perfect fit, so here I am! I'm excited to explore the possibilities of combining textiles with computer science.
