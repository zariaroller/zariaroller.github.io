This C program mimics the behavior of my circuit plushy. The variables *btn* (button) and *swt* (switch) control the LEDs, and this program outputs whether each light is "ON" or "OFF" - see examples of my output below. My tip to my past self is to not overthink the assignment and get caught up in trying to create nested "ifs."
