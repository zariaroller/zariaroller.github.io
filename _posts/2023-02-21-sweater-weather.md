For this coding assignment, I created a C program that outputs different statements based on the temperature (see output examples below). One tip I'd give is to be careful with using < and <= - for example, if you have an if statement for temperatures < 50 and another else if statement for temperatures > 50, then you'll be missing an output when temperature is set to exactly 50.
