This week I added a homemade switch to my sewing sampler. The LED lights up when the conductive thread patches touch *and* the paper clip touches the conductive fabric. Pictured below is my paper protoype, alligator clip prototype, and final product. I had some difficulty getting a good satin stitch with the conductive thread - as you can see from my fabric, I was more successful when using regular embroidery thread - so I'd recommend using an embroidery hoop if you have one, since the fabric puckers easily with the conductive thread.
