For my final project, I created a **Light-Up Fanny Pack Cover**. When I go biking or skating at night, I want pedestrians and cars to know I'm there, and this project achieves that! When the light sensor detects that it's dark, the LEDs turn on. If the switch is off, they will blink in a marquee pattern. If the switch is on, they'll increase and decrease in brightness in a fading pattern. This project is detachable (connected by velcro) and even has a little pocket where I can store extra things that wouldn't otherwise fit in my fanny pack. Not only is this project practical, but it also elevates the style of my fanny pick with the embroidered flowers and leaves. 

**Materials**:
* black felt
* embroidery thread in assorted colors
* conductive thread
* regular thread
* 6 inches of velcro
* 4 LEDs
* light sensor
* switch
* battery

**Tips to my past self:**
1. Plan the layout carefully! When there's many components, it's easy to run out of space or accidentally cross traces, and it's better to know this ahead of time rather than sewing on-the-fly. 
2. Remember to think about the edge cases while writing code. 
3. Test everything in short pieces, and incrementally increase the components involved. 

Pictured below is my project in various stages: the paper protoype, alligator clip prototype, and some photos of it in its final form. 

For the fade pattern, part of my code was adapted from the Arduino Fade example program.
