My name is **Zaria**, and I'm a senior studying Economics and Africana Studies. I have some basic experience with sewing - mending clothes, sewing buttons, embroidery, and the like. I'm proficient at coding in Stata and a beginner in R. I hope to gain some more coding skills in this class and better understand what you can achieve with Arduino, as well as brush up on my hand sewing skills. One boring fact about me is that

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
