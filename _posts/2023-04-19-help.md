For this assignment I created an Arduino script that plays a different morse code pattern depending on whether the circuit is open or closed. It spells either my name or SOS. A tip I'd give to my past self is to think about how to make the code as adaptable as possible - storing dot/dash values at the top, making each letter a separate function, etc.
